## RSMAS InSAR Atmospheric Column Water Vapor over CONUS

This repository is for high-resolution atmospheric column water vapor (CWV) retrieval based on Inteferograms SAR data (InSAR)
Microwaves-based satellites have difficulties in detecting vapor field over lands, due to surface properties.
Interferograms of SAR, used to detecting surface displacements, provide an unprecedented chance to measure the vapor field with super fine resolutions (~few meters)<br>

The signal containing the zenith water vapor delay (ZWD) between two acquisition time is obtained from InSAR and the absolute value of ZWD is then derived with GPS stations (our ground truth for adjustment)<br>

InSAR-CWV observations show unpresedented fine resolutions for water vapor over lands, compared to our top numerical weather predictions.<br>
